Dependency Injection

I am using dependency injection within the MarketingFirm class. This design allows me to inject the 
ISweepstakes Manager that will be used into the class so that it doesn't have to be created wtihin the class.
By doing this I am loosely connecting the two classes which makes making changes to the program down the road easier. 
This allows for the classes to be less dependent on one another.
